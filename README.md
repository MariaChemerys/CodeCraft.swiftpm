<h1 align="center">CodeCraft</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
What if programming concepts could introduce themselves to students? Imagine a function with a thick moustache or a variable wearing hippie accessories explaining their purpose to learners.
In CodeCraft, the MacOS game where programming concepts are personified as optimistic robots, this fantasy becomes a reality. Personification enables concepts to show how they operate and
interact. For example, in CodeCraft an array of numbers proudly presents its ability to store multiple values (elements). A loop arranges these elements circularly around itself and takes
them one by one, demonstrating its duty to perform iterations.
